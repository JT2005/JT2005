<p>Hello friends ✋. I'm a high school sophomore who recently gained a passion for coding! In particular, I'm working on <b>games</b> 🎮 and creating <b>websites</b> 💻 :D</p>
<p>Love to <b>learn</b> & open to <b>anything</b> 😁! I'm completely self-taught in <i>JavaScript</i>, <i>HTML</i> & <i>CSS</i>. Currently learning Python :p</p>
<h4>Have many grand ambitions:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>get involved in many hacking events 😙</li>
  <li>become a software developer 😙</li>
  <li>word domination 🙂</li>
</ul>
<sub>(although participating in events may prove to be the most challenging for me as I can get very nervous hehe 😅)</sub>
